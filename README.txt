Welcome in my python project

To successfully use this monkey classifier assure you to:
1. Run every following command lines from .\tp9_mathias_rihet
2. Use 'pip install -r requirements' to get all the required libraries
3. Use 'monkey_classif.py -h' to see classifier's commands

Notes:
#Pasting directly the .csv file to load in this directory will simplify the process a lot.

#The monkeys.csv file already here is the one initially used for the project.

#Don't hesitate to also use '-h' on subcommand

Enjoy !
