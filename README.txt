Welcome in my python project

To successfully use this monkey classifier assure you to:
1. Run every following command lines from .\tp9_mathias_rihet
2. Use 'pip install -r requirements' to get all the required libraries
3. Use 'monkey_classif.py -h' to see classifier's commands

Notes:
#Pasting directly the .csv file to load in this directory will simplify the process a lot.

#The monkeys.csv file already here is the one we needed to download on Arche with the 'color' column replaced by 'fur_color'
 indeed, exercises specified to use a 'fur_color' column and not a 'color' column.

#Don't hesitate to also use '-h' on subcommand

Enjoy !
